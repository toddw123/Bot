# Bot
Small project to create a clientless xenimus bot

This project is not going to get too much time put into it. I dont have very much free time to devote right now,
but i wanted to get this all put up for others to use if they want.

Im on a linux machine (Xubuntu) and the command i currently use to compile the project is:
g++ main.cpp packet.cpp crypto.cpp xmlParser.cpp -pthread -std=c++11 -o bot
